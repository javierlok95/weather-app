### **Description**
To showcase of my front-end development skills, I have built a weather app. This application provides real-time weather information for any location worldwide. Through a clean and intuitive user interface, users can effortlessly search for a city and instantly retrieve detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. With a responsive design, the Weather App seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices. Powered by modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React this project demonstrates my ability to create dynamic and user-centric web applications. Explore the Weather App and witness firsthand how I bring data to life through engaging visuals and a smooth user experience.
